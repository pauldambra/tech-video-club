At Co-op Digital we have an engineering community of practice and it's expected and allowed we'll spend time learning together. Part of that is our video club.

A video club is a weekly session where we gather to watch and discuss a (work related) video.

It's weekly so that if someone has to miss one session they only have to go two weeks between attending. Thanks to [Emily Webber's "Communities of Practice, the Missing Piece of Your Agile Organisation"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Owrovki73o) for that advice.

We have:

 * an event in a shared calendar so everyone can see when and where it will be
 * a trello board so we can propose and curate the list of videos
 * rooms with a TV in so we can all see
 * freedom to choose whether all or part of the time counts as our lunch break

# choosing the videos

We use a Trello board to propose and curate the list of videos. Each of the cards on the Trello board has a link to the video and a label showing the length of the video so we can plan which videos to watch.

We're lucky to have several colleagues that do watch tech videos and can suggest them. The videos we've watched are shared on this site so you can take advantage of our curation.

In our experience overly technical topics can be a bit heavy over lunch (I'm looking at you lambda calculus) but it's important to choose videos appropriate for the audience.

# organising the thing

Video Club runs at the same time each week and is advertised in a shared calendar. Attendance tends to be better if the organiser reminds everyone a couple of days before what video is scheduled and what room it's in.

We run them at noon so that people can attend without impacting on other responsibilities but there's no requirement that this time is a person's lunch hour. Not everyone can consistently give up their personal time and we trust that people will organise their day sensibly and respectfully.

The organiser should try to avoid videos that last a full hour so people are able to grab lunch or make their way to the room without rushing.

The organiser is responsible for arriving on time, getting set up so we can watch the video, and checking the audio/video quality of the video ahead of time.

When the video is finished the organiser can kickstart discussion if it doesn't start naturally with a question like:

 * so what do we think?
 * how do we do at blah?
 * who already does blah? -> how does that work?

## We've watched a video almost every week for a little more than a year and it has been a great way to get to know each other and to learn together
